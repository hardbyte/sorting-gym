# Sorting Gym - OpenAI Environments for Sorting

Based on the paper _Strong Generalization and Efficiency in Neural Programs_

This repos aims to:
- implement the basic sorting environment/s from above paper.
- implement the manual agents from the paper to test environment.

Stretch goals:
- Perhaps abstract out Neural Controller Mixin/Environment Wrapper?
- Consider a different instruction set.

Agents may want to consider supporting parametric/auto-regressive actions:
